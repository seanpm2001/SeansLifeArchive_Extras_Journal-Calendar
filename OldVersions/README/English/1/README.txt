# Seanpm2001 Journal Calendar

> **Proposed:** `2024, September 15th`

## About

A single event calendar for keeping track of my journal progress from 2016, September 27th onward (but the calendar will go back to 2001, March 1st to fit the scope of the project, not March 21st, as this would leave out a lot of the month)

## Legend

- `#FF0000` **Red:** Absolutely no journal work (pre-dominantly pre-2016 September)
- `#00FF00` **Green:** Journal work done in full
- `#0000FF` **Blue:** Journal notes only

## Web app

Originally, I was stuck on deciding whether to make a web app (the easy route) or a Python GUI app (the harder route) In the end, I decided to do both, the web app first (to get a good concept going) then a GUI Python app to challenge myself (practice Python GUI programming) and to have a standalone basic application. I still need to find the time to start.
